  Reporting & Analytics Specialist at Fred Loya Insurance
  <br><br>
  My current position introduced me to how internal & external stakeholders require large amounts of reporting through data analytics to maintain and grow companies. 

I have always seen the appeal on the small scale for data analytics within small clubs or basic statistics for any company. However after working with data on a larger scale, I realized just how engaging it is for me to gather and visualize massive amounts of data to produce outputs that so many people can admire and utilize.

My passion & personal development has motivated me to continue pursuing a Bachelor's degree while working full time. Furthering my career path and achievements are important to me while I strive to continuously improve myself at work and school.
